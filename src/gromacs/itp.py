# This script generates intermolecular bond definitions for a system of multiple monomers.
# Each monomer is read from a GRO file, and specified atom pairs are converted to global indices.
# Bonds are created sequentially, with ring closures applied every 'nmols_in_rosette' monomers.
# The resulting bonds are written in GROMACS [ intermolecular_interactions ] format
# (ai aj funct length k), ready to be appended to the topology file.
#
# BEHAVIOUR CHANGE: the ring-closure wrap used to be computed on the 1-based atom
# index directly, which made the closing bond of a rosette come out as atom 0 --
# not a valid GROMACS index -- and, for the second and later rosettes, point at an
# atom belonging to the *previous* rosette. Both are now fixed. Any
# intermolecular_bond.itp generated before this change should be regenerated:
# with natoms=10, nmols_in_rosette=6 the closures move from (51, 0) to (51, 60)
# and from (111, 60) to (111, 120).
