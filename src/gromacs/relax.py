"""Relax a structure with a soft-core LJ potential.

For structures built by geometric placement, neighbouring monomers can start
with atom pairs close enough that plain 12-6 LJ gives a practically infinite
force and minimization fails. Here the LJ part of the force field is replaced
by a soft-core form

    4*eps*((sig^6/(r^6+delta^6))^2 - sig^6/(r^6+delta^6))

whose energy stays finite at r = 0 while delta > 0. Minimization is run once
per stage in STAGES, ending at delta = 0 where the expression is exactly the
original LJ, so the final structure is relaxed on the real potential.

The inter-fiber hydrogen bonds that grompp would pull in via ``-DINTER`` are
honoured too, but not through GromacsTopFile: OpenMM has no handler for
GROMACS' [ intermolecular_interactions ], and would silently attribute those
bonds to the last [ moleculetype ] instead. Instead, the atom pairs are read
straight from the #included .itp and pinned to their starting positions with
a stiff CustomExternalForce, which sidesteps the same problem without needing
OpenMM to understand the bond section at all.

Note what that substitution costs: a GROMACS harmonic bond restrains the
*distance* between the pair, so a pair placed too far apart is pulled together
to the bond length. Pinning instead freezes both atoms wherever the geometric
construction put them, at FIXED_ATOM_K stiffness. The H-bonded core therefore
keeps its constructed geometry and only the periphery relaxes. Use
add_intermolecular_bonds() instead if you want the real bonded behaviour.

The final structure is not guaranteed to match what GROMACS would produce, but
it is a good starting point for a subsequent GROMACS minimization.
